                    <p class="lead">It's hard to believe when you really think about it, but business aircraft brokers worldwide struggle to sign mandates with buyers. "Isn't the seller paying you?" they ask. Here's why that's the wrong question:</p>

                    <div class="service-option">
                        <h3>1. Because it's hard fucking work</h3>
                        <p>Finding the perfect aircraft while helping you avoid pitfalls requires expertise that deserves compensation. This isn't scrolling through listings - it's knowing which tail numbers to avoid before they even hit the market.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="service-option">
                        <h3>2. Your broker should work FOR YOU, not the seller</h3>
                        <p>When commission comes only from sellers, guess whose interests get prioritized? Paying your broker aligns their incentives with yours. No hidden agendas, no pushing inventory that benefits them more than you.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="service-option">
                        <h3>3. Transparency beats hidden markups</h3>
                        <p>If you're not paying your broker directly, you're paying indirectly through inflated prices. With a buyer's agreement, you know exactly what the service costs instead of wondering where the extra $200K disappeared.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="service-option">
                        <h3>4. It separates tire-kickers from serious buyers</h3>
                        <p>The market is flooded with "maybe" buyers. A signed mandate cuts through the noise, making sellers actually return your calls with real numbers instead of "let's see where the market goes" non-answers.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="service-option">
                        <h3>5. One professional > fifty random inquiries</h3>
                        <p>When you blast the market with inquiries through every channel, you become "that guy who never buys." A single broker maintains your credibility while filtering out the bullshit.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="key-point">
                        <p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Paying your broker isn't an expense - it's leverage. It transforms you from another maybe-buyer to a serious client who gets first looks at off-market deals and actual price transparency. The 1% you spend on representation saves you 10% on purchase price and 100% of the headaches.</p>
